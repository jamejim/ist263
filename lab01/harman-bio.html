    </head>
    <body>
        My name is James Harman and I am an undergraduate student studying information management and technology. I am looking to get an accelerated masters in library science so that I can go on to become a librarian specializing in technology and digital literacy. I’m a 4.0 student admitted to The National Honor Society who graduated high school with academic achievement and recognition for my work in social justice. I’ve been working in libraries since I was fourteen and have been using computers since before I was in kindergarten. I can usually be found reading, listening to podcasts, or watching The Addams Family for the thousandth time.
