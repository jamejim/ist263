        <h1>James Harman's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            My name is James Harman and I am an undergraduate student studying <strong>information management and technology</strong>. I am looking to get an <strong>accelerated masters in library science</strong> so that I can go on to become a systems librarian. I’m a 4.0 student admitted to The National Honor Society who graduated high school with academic achievement and recognition for my work in social justice. I’ve been working in libraries since I was fourteen and have been using computers since before I was in kindergarten.
